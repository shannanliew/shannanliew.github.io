            <h1>The Hidden Cost of Poor Air Quality: How Pollution Quietly Undermines Urban Economies and Health</h1>

            <p>As cities grapple with the growing burden of air pollution, its impact extends far beyond environmental
                concerns. This project delves into how degraded air quality covertly strains urban economies, from lost
                productivity to rising healthcare costs. By examining data on pollution levels, economic output, and
                health outcomes, we reveal the often-overlooked financial and societal costs of air
                pollution—highlighting the urgent need for informed, data-driven policy interventions.</p>

                <p>The Global PM2.5 Levels Map provides a visual representation of the average fine particulate matter
                    (PM2.5) concentrations across countries in 2020. Using a choropleth design, the map highlights the
                    intensity of air pollution globally, with darker shades indicating higher PM2.5 levels. This
                    visualization enables quick identification of regions facing severe air quality challenges, such as
                    South Asia and parts of the Middle East, while also showcasing areas with cleaner air.</p>
                <p>To create the global map visualizing PM2.5 levels, I began by scraping PM2.5 data for countries from
                    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_air_pollution">Wikipedia page</a>
                    containing country-level air pollution statistics. Using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, I
                    processed the raw HTML content to extract relevant data, cleaned the dataset to remove missing
                    values, and standardized the format to include ISO3 codes. Next, I integrated this data with a
                    GeoJSON world map file, ensuring that each country's ISO3 code matched the GeoJSON properties for
                    spatial visualization. The map was then designed and rendered using Kepler.gl, where I applied a
                    color gradient to represent varying PM2.5 levels, from low (blue) to high (red), making the
                    intensity of air pollution visually distinguishable. I added hover tooltips to display specific
                    country names and PM2.5 values for interactivity. Finally, I exported the map as an HTML file and
                    embedded it seamlessly into my project page for easy navigation and exploration.</p>

                        <figure id="project-charts-chart1"></figure>

                        <p>To visualize PM2.5 levels across six major cities from 2010 to 2019 and their year-over-year
                            changes, I began by sourcing data from the <a
                                href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database"
                                target="_blank">WHO Ambient Air Quality Database</a>, which tracks PM2.5 concentrations
                            in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³) for cities worldwide.</p>
                        <p>Using Python, I processed the dataset to focus on the years 2010 to 2019, selecting cities
                            with at least seven years of data to ensure continuity. From this subset, I chose Beijing,
                            Singapore, New York, London, São Paulo, and Delhi for analysis. The reason for choosing
                            these cities are because they are some of the most significant and influential cities in the
                            world. The data preparation
                            included filtering for the selected cities and years, calculating the year-over-year
                            percentage change in PM2.5 concentrations using Python’s pct_change method grouped by city,
                            and cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and standardizing city names. The
                            cleaned data, which included columns for city names, years, PM2.5 concentrations, and
                            percentage changes, was then exported to a CSV file for visualization.</p>
                        <p>The time-series chart highlights the varying trajectories of air quality across these urban
                            centers, with notable improvements in cities like Beijing, which saw a steady decline in
                            PM2.5 levels over the decade. Conversely, Delhi exhibited significant volatility, with
                            periods of sharp increases and decreases, reflecting ongoing challenges in managing air
                            pollution. The <i>interactive scatter plot</i> of yearly percentage changes reveals the magnitude and frequency
                            of fluctuations, with cities like London demonstrating relatively stable air quality
                            compared to the more dramatic changes seen in Delhi and Beijing.</p>

                <figure id="project-charts-chart2"></figure>

                <p>To create this visualization, I extracted data from the WHO Ambient Air Quality database and filtered
                    it to include only relevant columns: who_region, year, and pm25_concentration. I replaced the WHO
                    region codes with their full names, such as Africa and Southeast Asia, to make the data more
                    readable. Next, I calculated the average annual PM2.5 concentration for each region from 2010 to
                    2019, rounding the values to two decimal places for clarity.</p>
                <p>Using Vega-Lite, I built an interactive area chart that allows users to filter the data by year with
                    sliders. The chart includes interactive sliders that allow users to dynamically filter the time
                    range (start and end years). This functionality ensures that the visualization is flexible and
                    suitable for exploratory analysis.</p>
                <p>While PM2.5 levels in most regions exhibited a general downward trend, particularly in Europe and the
                    Americas, indicating improved air quality over time, Southeast Asia remains an outlier with
                    consistently high levels, underscoring the need for stricter air pollution control measures in this
                    region.</p>
                <p>It is also <b>important to note</b> WHO regions such as <i>Eastern Mediterranean</i> and
                    <i>Non-member states</i> were not included in this analysis as data was scarce/incomplete, which
                    could lead to sampling bias.

                <h2>Analyzing the Relationship Between PM2.5 Levels and NCD Mortality Rates</h2>
                <figure id="project-charts-chart3"></figure>

                <p>To create this regression chart, I first gathered data from two separate sources: average PM2.5
                    concentrations (2010–2019) from the WHO Ambient Air Quality database and Non-Communicable Disease
                    (NCD) mortality rates per 100,000 population from the <a
                        href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api" target="_blank">Global Health Observatory
                        API</a>. Using Python, I preprocessed the datasets. This involved filtering for countries with
                    complete yearly data and aggregating PM2.5 levels by year. Similarly, for the NCD data, I extracted
                    values only for relevant years and ensured consistent spatial dimensions (country codes).</p>
                <p>Using Vega-Lite, I plotted a regression chart to examine the relationship between average PM2.5
                    levels and NCD mortality rates. The regression line was calculated using the Vega-Lite regression
                    transform, and I included an R² annotation to assess the model’s goodness-of-fit.</p>
                <p>The chart reveals a moderate positive correlation between PM2.5 concentrations and NCD mortality
                    rates, with an R² value of 0.35. This indicates that 35% of the variability in NCD mortality rates
                    can be explained by average PM2.5 levels. Countries with higher average PM2.5 levels, such as India
                    and Bangladesh, tend to show higher NCD mortality rates. Conversely, nations with lower PM2.5
                    levels, such as the USA and Australia, generally exhibit lower NCD mortality rates. These findings
                    align with existing research linking air pollution to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.</p>
                <p>The analysis has several limitations. It includes only countries with complete data from 2010–2019,
                    which may bias results toward nations with better reporting infrastructure. The regression
                    demonstrates correlation but does not establish causation, as other factors like healthcare access
                    and socioeconomic disparities likely influence NCD mortality rates. The linear model may
                    oversimplify the potentially non-linear relationship between air pollution and health outcomes.
                    Finally, the model may suffer from heteroskedasticity, as variability in NCD mortality rates could
                    differ across levels of PM2.5 concentrations, impacting the reliability of statistical inferences.

                <p>I used <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#article-licence" target="_blank">life
                        expectancy data from Our World in Data</a> and PM2.5 concentration data to create the chart.
                    Using pandas, I cleaned and merged both datasets, focusing on records from 2010 to 2019. Columns
                    were standardized for compatibility, and only rows with complete data were retained. The merged data
                    was saved as a CSV for visualization.</p>
                <p>To create the interactive scatter plot, I used Vega-Lite, mapping PM2.5 levels (x-axis) against life
                    expectancy (y-axis). Each data point represents a country-year pair, color-coded by country.
                    Tooltips were added for detailed information, and an <i>interactive selection feature</i> allows
                    users to isolate data points for individual countries.</p>
                <p>In a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DiUo30N-olVaUYhYEFdgw4OoBJpQ-J6R?usp=sharing"
                        target="_blank">Python notebook</a>, I used scikit-learn to calculate the R-squared value for
                    the relationship between PM2.5 levels and life expectancy, yielding a value of 0.4000. This
                    indicates a moderate negative correlation between the variables.</p>
                <p>The chart reveals a negative correlation between PM2.5 levels and life expectancy, with countries
                    like Bangladesh and India showing low life expectancies and high PM2.5 levels. Developed countries
                    such as Australia and Spain cluster in the upper-left, indicating higher life expectancies and
                    cleaner air. Outliers, such as Mongolia in 2011, demonstrate significant spikes in PM2.5 while
                    maintaining relatively stable life expectancy levels. The HTML code for the notebook was extracted
                    to be embedded our project webpage.</p>
                <p><b>Limitations:</b> The dataset is restricted to a specific time range (2010-2019) and includes only
                    countries with complete data, potentially excluding significant regions. The linear regression model
                    assumes a linear relationship, which may oversimplify the complex factors influencing life
                    expectancy beyond air pollution. Additionally, the R-squared value of 0.40 indicates that while
                    there is some correlation, other factors not included in this analysis significantly impact life
                    expectancy.</p>

                <h2>Does Economic Development Inevitably Lead To a Decrease in Air Pollution?</h2>
                <figure id="project-charts-chart5"></figure>

                <p>In this research, I explored the relationship between economic development, as measured by GDP per
                    capita, and air pollution levels, represented by PM2.5 concentrations, to address the question: Does
                    economic development inevitably lead to a decrease in air pollution? The data for this analysis were
                    sourced from publicly available repositories. <a
                        href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD" target="_blank">GDP per capita</a>
                    and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth" target="_blank">population data</a> were
                    obtained from
                    the World Bank, while <a
                        href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/sedac-ciesin-sedac-sdei-apm25-urban-1.00"
                        target="_blank">PM2.5 concentration levels</a> were derived from NASA's SEDAC. These datasets
                    were
                    cleaned, standardized, and merged using Python. Key preprocessing steps included aligning country
                    codes, ensuring consistent temporal coverage (2008–2015), and assigning regions to each country for
                    a holistic analysis.</p>
                <p>To visualize this relationship, this chart employs a
                    log scale for both GDP per capita and PM2.5 concentrations to manage the wide range of values and
                    improve interpretability. It features an interactive year slider, allowing temporal analysis of
                    changes in air pollution levels alongside economic development. Additional functionalities include a
                    <i>region-based legend toggle, which enables users to isolate specific regions</i> for comparative
                    analysis. Bubbles representing individual countries vary in size, proportional to their population,
                    and provide detailed tooltips with GDP per capita, PM2.5 levels, and population data for deeper
                    insights.
                </p>
                <p>Significant regional variations emerge. Asian countries often display high PM2.5 concentrations
                    across a wide range of GDP levels, reflecting the environmental costs of rapid industrialization. In
                    contrast, Oceania consistently exhibits the lowest levels of PM2.5 pollution, despite spanning a
                    wide range of GDP per capita. This observation suggests that factors beyond economic development,
                    such as geographic isolation, lower industrialization levels, or strong environmental policies, may
                    contribute to maintaining clean air in this region.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, North American countries generally demonstrate lower PM2.5 levels compared to Europe,
                    even among countries with similar GDP per capita levels. This trend could be attributed to
                    differences in industrial practices, energy sources, urbanization patterns, or the implementation of
                    air quality regulations. For example, North America's reliance on natural gas and renewable energy,
                    compared to Europe’s historically high use of coal in certain regions, may partly explain this
                    discrepancy.</p>
                <p>The analysis of the relationship between economic development and air pollution reveals that higher
                    GDP per capita does not inevitably lead to reduced PM2.5 concentrations. These findings underscore
                    the importance of adopting region-specific strategies to mitigate air pollution, as economic growth
                    alone is insufficient to ensure environmental sustainability.</p>

                <p>This Differences-in-Differences (DiD) chart analyzes the impact of policy changes on PM2.5 air
                    pollution levels in Beijing (treatment group) and Shanghai (control group).</p>
                <p>The Differences-in-Differences (DiD) analysis demonstrates the substantial impact of <a href="https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/policy-impacts/china-national-air-quality-action-plan-2014/" target="_blank">Beijing's
                    2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan</a>, a landmark policy initiative aimed at mitigating severe air
                    pollution. The DiD estimate of -32.057 µg/m³ captures the causal effect of this policy, showcasing
                    its significant contribution to improving air quality beyond what could be explained by broader
                    trends, as seen in Shanghai (the control group).</p>

                <h2>Using Machine Learning to Explore Life Expectancy Predictions
                </h2>
                <figure id="project-charts-chart7"></figure>

                <p>I leveraged machine learning to predict life expectancy under varying environmental and socioeconomic
                    conditions. Starting with a cleaned dataset containing GDP per capita, PM2.5 levels, <a
                        href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita?time=2017" target="_blank">CO2
                        emissions</a>, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS"
                        target="_blank">healthcare spending</a>, <a
                        href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS" target="_blank">urbanization
                        rates</a>, and <a
                        href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/life-expectancy-at-birth-(years)"
                        target="_blank">life expectancy</a>, I trained a Random Forest Regressor on 80% of the data and
                    validated it on the remaining 20%. The model achieved strong performance metrics, with a Mean
                    Squared Error (MSE) of 3.22 and an R² score of 0.95.</p>
                <p>Next, I conducted a sensitivity analysis by simulating reductions in PM2.5 levels (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%,
                    50%, and 70%) and predicting how life expectancy could change across global regions. I visualized
                    the results using Vega-Lite to create an interactive dark-mode chart, enhanced with tooltips for
                    better interpretability.</p>
                <p>The analysis revealed that PM2.5 reductions had a modest but regionally varied impact on life
                    expectancy. While regions such as Africa showed consistent improvements with decreasing PM2.5
                    levels, other regions like Europe and North America exhibited smaller changes, suggesting that air
                    quality improvements alone might not significantly influence life expectancy in these areas. The
                    results highlighted the interplay between multiple factors, including healthcare spending and
                    economic development, in shaping life expectancy outcomes.</p>
                <p>However, this analysis has several limitations. The dataset spans only 2008–2015, which restricts the
                    temporal scope and may not capture recent trends or interventions. Missing data for some countries
                    and regions could introduce bias, underrepresenting key areas. Additionally, the Random Forest
                    model, while robust, is not inherently interpretable, making causal inferences challenging.
                    Correlations between features, such as urbanization rates and healthcare expenditure, may also
                    confound the results. These factors suggest the findings should be viewed as exploratory rather than
                    definitive.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This journey into the hidden impacts of air pollution has been both revealing and thought-provoking.
                    Through data, machine learning, and visualization, I uncovered how PM2.5 levels quietly chip away at
                    life expectancy, particularly in regions already grappling with socio-economic challenges. While
                    cleaner air consistently improves health outcomes in some areas, the story is far from
                    simple—economic growth, healthcare spending, and urbanization all intertwine in ways that defy easy
                    answers.
                </p>
                <p>What stood out the most is the stark contrast between regions. Rapidly industrializing areas like
                    South Asia face the steepest climb, while others, like Oceania, showcase how geography and strong
                    policies can shield populations from the worst effects of pollution. It’s a sobering reminder that
                    improving air quality isn’t just a technical challenge but a deeply human one, shaped by the choices
                    we make as societies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This work has its limits. The dataset spans a narrow timeframe, and the models, while insightful,
                    only scratch the surface of this complex issue. Still, the results highlight the undeniable value of
                    clean air and the urgent need for region-specific strategies. Air pollution isn’t just an
                    environmental issue—it’s a public health and equity crisis.
                </p>
                <p>In the end, this project is a call to action: to use data and science not just to understand the
                    world but to drive meaningful change in it. The tools are here; it’s up to us to use them wisely.

Data source:,"Ambient Air Quality Database, WHO, April 2022.
The primary sources of data were official reports of countries sent to WHO upon request, official national and subnational reports and national and subnational websites that contain measurements of PM10 or PM2.5 and ground measurements compiled in the framework of the Global Burden of Disease project. For NO2, ground measurements compiled for research by Larkin et al. in 2017 were obtained. Measurements reported by the following regional networks were also used: Clean Air for Asia, the Air quality e-reporting database of the European Environment Agency for Europe and the AirNow Programme from the United States embassies and consulates. If such official data were not available, values from peer-reviewed journals were used."

Metadata:,
Indicator,Annual mean concentration of particulate matter of less than 10 microns of diameter (PM10) [ug/m3] and of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5)  [ug/m3] and of NO2  [ug/m3] in cities and localities. 
Rationale,"Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. These particles and gases are able to penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases."
Method of Measurement,"The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 10 or 2.5 microns in diameters and of NO2 are common measures of air pollution. The mean city concentration is based on daily measurements, or data which could be aggregated into annual means. In the absence of annual means, measurements covering a more limited period of the year were  used in exceptional circumstances. However, only data for which the temporal coverage was considered representative of interseasonal variability were included. Generally, a cutoff of 50% temporal coverage was chosen, with exception for low- and middle-income countries with limited data availability. 



"
Method of estimation,"Annual means are reported as provided in the primary data source, or an average of the cities' monitoring stations were used. In order to present air quality that is largely representative for human exposure, urban measurement characterized as urban background, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas were used. Stations characterized as particular ""hot spots"" or exclusively industrial areas were not included, unless they were contained in reported city means and could not be dissociated.  This selection is in line with the aim of capturing representative values for human exposure. The location of hot spots, often measured for the purpose of capturing the cities' maximum values, and industrial areas, were deemed less likely to be representative for the mean exposure of a significant part of a city's population. ""Hot spots"" were either designated as such by the original reports, or were qualified as such due to their exceptional nature (e.g. exceptionally busy roads etc.). Omitting them may have lead to an underestimation of the mean air pollution level of a city.

"
,"Where the data from various sources were available for a city, only the latest data and most reliable sources were used. Data measured from the year 2010 to the year 2019 were included in the database with a few countries also providing data from 2020.
"
,"PM10 type and PM2.5 type describe if the PM10 and PM2.5 values were measured or converted from the corresponding PM2.5 or PM10, respectively."
Limitations,"Ideally, the monitoring data used to calculate the average annual PM and NO2 concentrations should be collected throughout the year, for several years, to reduce bias owing to seasonal fluctuations or to a non-representative year.
Care should be taken to ensure that the monitors used are not unduly influenced by a single source of pollution (i.e. a power plant, factory or highway); rather, the monitors should reflect exposures over a wide area.
Although it is likely that PM and NO2 data will be available only for larger cities, residents of agglomerations of less than 100'000 inhabitants and of rural areas are also exposed to PM and NO2 from local industrial activity, transportation, biomass fuels, open burning and regional haze."
,"Data from different countries are of limited comparability because of :
(a) Different location of measurement stations; 
(b) Different measurement methods;
(c) Different temporal coverage of certain measurements; if only part of the year was covered, the measurement may significantly deviate from the annual mean due to seasonal variability;  
(d) Possible inclusion of data which were not eligible for this database due to insufficient information to ensure compliance;
(e) Heterogeneous quality of measurements;
(f) Omission of data which are known to exist, but which could not yet be accessed due to language issues or limited accessibility.

WHO Air Quality Guidelines,"The WHO guideline values for particulate matter are 15 μg/m3 for PM10, and 5 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 10 μg/m3 for NO2 . Additional information on interim targets are also provided in the guidelines: https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/345329  "
Temporal coverage,"The percentage of coverage of the year, as a mean of the percentage coverage of the station, when available."
Status,"The values that are referred to as ""Under review"" are currently being updated"
Worksheets,"""city database 2022"":  Contains annual mean PM and NO2 values for all cities for all available years"
